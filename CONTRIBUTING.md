## Features

Have an interesting idea, or feature that you think the app could benefit from?

Create a [new issue](https://github.com/robertjnielsen/GooberEats/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=) utilizing the Feature Request template.

Be sure to fill out as much information about the proposed feature as possible. Also make sure to provide any additional information in the _**Additional Context**_ section as to whether or not you have started to write any code for this new feature.

Your issue will be reviewed and a determination will be made if there is a decision to move forward with the new feature.

**Please do NOT submit a Pull Request for any code you have written unless it pertains directly to an issue assigned to you.**

## Bugs

Have you found a bug in the GooberEats application?

**If you believe the bug could be a security risk, do not post an issue, instead send a detailed email to [robert.j.nielsen@outlook.com](mailto:robert.j.nielsen@outlook.com).**

If the bug is NOT a security concern, please submit a [new issue](https://github.com/robertjnielsen/GooberEats/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=), utilizing the Bug Report template. Provide as much detailed information as possible, as well as screenshots of the bug (again, if possible).

Your issue will be reviewed and a determination will be made if there is in fact a bug, and what the decision will be moving forward.

**Please do NOT submit a Pull Request for any code you have written unless it pertains directly to an issue assigned to you.**

## Documentation

Detailed and ligible documentation is a neccessity for a project to succeed.

If you see any errors or issues with our current documentation, or would like to help us build a strong documentation base for GooberEats, please submit a [new issue](https://github.com/robertjnielsen/GooberEats/issues/new?assignees=&labels=documentation&template=documentation_request.md&title=) using the Documentation Request template. Provide as much detailed information as possible, as well as screenshots of the problem areas (if that is the subject of the issue).

Your issue will be reviewed and a determination will be made if there is a decision to move forward with the documentation changes.

**Please do NOT submit a Pull Request for any code you have written unless it pertains directly to an issue assigned to you.**

## Testing

Unit testing should be performed on any individual items of code you write as they pertain to business logic. This includes, but is not neccessarily limited to:
- Controllers
- Interfaces
- Services
- View Models
- Any standalone methods or pieces of logic

The purpose of testing is to ensure that a predicted output or result / response will be accomplished for all logical operations. This helps minimize bugs and ensure interoperabiity between various segments of code.

If you submit a PR that does not include testing, and it is determined in the review that testing should be required, your code will be kicked back. At this point, either you, or somebody else can tackle testing, _however_ do not assume that somebody else will always be willing to write your unit tests for you. If it is not a critical piece of code, it might get marked closed as denied if nobody is willing to write tests for it. Besides, it is good practice to write tests for all of your code where possible.

## Styling

All code submitted to GooberEats should follow the [Style Guide](https://github.com/robertjnielsen/GooberEats/blob/master/STYLE_GUIDE.md) established.

This is to ensure that code is legible, maintainable, and easy to navigate / work through by anyone on the team. Someone else is bound to work through code that you've written at some point, and it's a guarantee that if you're new to the team, you will work through someone else's code at some point.

So long as all code follows the same formatting and style, everyone should be able to quickly and easily navigate and read through anyone else's work.

## Pull Requests

**Please do NOT submit a Pull Request for any code you have written unless it pertains directly to an issue assigned to you.**

You may have seen that statement a number of times throughout this document by now. We _**really**_ want to reiterate that, in case you haven't noticed.

If you have proposed a new issue relating to a bug, feature request, or documentation:

Your issue will be reviewed. It will be assigned to someone. If you have expressed interest in your issue that you would like to tackle the issue yourself then we will make that determination based upon the severity of the issue, as well as your available GitHub repository history. If the issue is assigned to you, that means you have been given the green light to start coding, and submit a Pull Request to our **staging** branch.

This pull request will be reviewed by a member of the GooberEats team. If approved, the pull request will be merged by a member of the team into the **staging** branch.

## Code Of Conduct
All contributors and members of the GooberEats team (including you) are required to follow our [Code Of Conduct](https://github.com/robertjnielsen/GooberEats/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) at all times.

Failure to do so will result in immediate action, determined by the offense.
